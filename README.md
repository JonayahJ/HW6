# Weather Forecast Application

## What I did
* I added a search bar to look for the data on any given city.
    * When the user searches for a city, then the city is saved in local storage and displayed in a list of previous queries.
* Then I added an area for the current weather data of the city.
* And then for the same city, I added a separate 5-day forecast for the rest of the week.

## Comments
My code is quite confusing and I'm not sure how to make it less so.  I found it difficult to change the search city, add more spacing between the dynamically added cards for the 5-day weather, and get the local storage working and appending right.  I got it to display Brooklyn, but changing the city is broken.
